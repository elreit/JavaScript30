    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2); //returns 100, 100
    age = 200;
    console.log(age, age2); // returns 200, 100 because the value of age goes into the variable at the same time. Same as strings:

    let name = 'Wes';
    let name2 = name;
    console.log(name, name2); // returns Wes Wes
    name = 'Wesley';
    console.log(name, name2); // returns Wesley Wes. if we change original (name), it won't update the next one (name2)

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    console.log(players, team); // returns "Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Poppy" and "Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Poppy"


    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // team[3] = 'Lux'; // this updates the team array and the original array players
    console.log(team, players); // returns "Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Lux" and "Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Lux".
    //Because we updated team, team is just a ref to the original array players.
    //So when we update any of the arrays it will go back to the original reference and also update (players)

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice(); // we can add/change elements to this array as it is a copy by calling .slide(),
    //and the original array of players will stay the same

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players); //also creates a copy

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
     const team4 = [...players]; //spread takes every item out of iterable and put it into the containing array and makes a copy
     team4[3] = 'Emma';
     console.log(team4);

     const team5 = Array.from(players);


    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.number = 99;


    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99}); //create empty object, fold in the properties from our object, 3rd argument to fold in our new properties
    console.log(cap2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const cap3 = {...person};

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep (shllow) - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const wes = {
      name: 'Wes',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@wesbos',
        facebook: 'wesbos.developer'
      }
    }
    console.clear();
    console.log(wes);

    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes, { twitter: '@coolman' });

    //need to deep clone to change the value of an element across all objects
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
